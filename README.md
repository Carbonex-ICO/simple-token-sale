# Simple Token Sale
[ ![Codeship Status for skmgoldin/simple-token-launch](https://app.codeship.com/projects/5392ad30-6041-0135-6b30-4614bcb67ade/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/239399)

This codebase can be used to deploy fixed-price, finite-supply token sales. It uses json conf files to specify sale parameters, supports token distributions for pre-sale buyers, and the distribution of timelocked tokens for founders. It also includes a comprehensive test suite.

# Initialize
```
npm install
npm run compile
```

# The tests
To run the tests, simply `npm run test`.

The parameters tested are the same as those which will be deployed. This means the tests can take a very long time if your start block is up in the millions, and some tests will be skipped if signing keys cannot be unlocked for the required accounts, particularly the final test block for the founder timelocking mechanisms. The `owner` address in `sale.json` must be the first address generated by the mnemonic in `secrets.json`.

# Composition of the repo
The repo is composed as a Truffle project. The test suite can be found in `test/sale.json`. The sale contract is in `contracts/Sale.sol`. The deployment scripts are in the `migrations` folder.

The Sale contract deploys the token contract, disburses funds to pre-sale purchasers and then deploys timelock contracts to store the founders tokens. `Disbursement.sol` and `Filter.sol` comprise the timelock contracts. Two `Disbursement.sol` contracts are deployed which unlock funds at a particular date. The `Filter.sol` contracts sit in front of them and allow particular addresses to withdraw particular amounts of funds.

# Using the repo to deploy a real token
Config files where the parameters of your own sale can be filled in are in the `conf` directory.

Note that the `owner` in `sale.json` must be the first address generated by a mnemonic in a `secrets.json` at the project root.

```
{
  "mnemonic": "igor cannot dunk"
}
```

Having done all that you can `truffle migrate --network mainnet`. Save the contents of your build and logs directories, you'll want to have all that data.
